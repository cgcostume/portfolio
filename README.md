# Daniel's Portfolio Theme

This portfolio is optimized for researchers and those who strive for a minimal, file-based content management.
The complete site's content is based on a json/yaml file per section (e.g., `contact.json`, `projects.json`, `publications.json`, `talks.json`, and `teaching.json`) as well as the pages `_config.yml` information.

### Development Commands
- `npm install` installs all necessary dependencies.
- `npm start` launches a local server for development and testing.
- `npm run build:dev` and `npm run build` are used to create the static site.

### Deployment
