# Daniel's Portfolio Theme

This portfolio is optimized for researchers and those who strive for a minimal, file-based content management.
The complete site's content is based on a json/yaml file per section (e.g., `contact.json`, `projects.json`, `publications.json`, `talks.json`, and `teaching.json`) as well as the pages `_config.yml` information.

## Development

This website uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Bootstrap 4](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Blueimp Gallery](https://github.com/blueimp/Bootstrap-Image-Gallery), can access the [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/), and [Formspree](http://formspree.io/).

#### Setting up the Build Environment (on Windows)

For the development and testing of the website jekyll (https://jekyllrb.com/) is required. A fast and simple setup of jekyll, is possible via chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/) either using the ```setup.bat``` script or proceed as follows (for non-Windows platforms the specific package managers, e.g., apt-get, can be used instead of Chocolatey):

* For installing chocolatey open a command prompt as administrator and run the following command:
```
@powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin
```
* Now close the command prompt and open a new one (not necessarily with administrative priviliges) to install jekyll (which requires ruby) by running:
```
choco install ruby -y
gem install jekyll
```

For deployment of the website, the following optimizations (mostly minimizations) that require node, npm as well as uncss, cssmin, and svgo should be considered.

* Open a command prompt and run;
```
choco install nodejs -y
npm install
npm update
```
This should already install all required packages listed in ```package.json```.
* However, if a package was not found (e.g., svgo), try manually installing it by running:
```
npm install -g svgo
```

#### Building the Website (any platform)

* Auto rebuilding (on any change) and watching the website (stored in '_site') can be done by running (requires only jekyll)
```
jekyll serve
```
With the server running, the website should be available at http://localhost:4000.
